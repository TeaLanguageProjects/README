**Warning: The Tea programming language is currently under development and everything may be unstable.**

Tea programming language is a new compiled object-oriented programming language.
If you need to provide suggestions for the language itself, please provide issus in the TEPs (Tea Enhancement Proposals) repository. If you need feedback on programming issues such as language virtual machines or compilers, please provide issus in the corresponding repository

(This project is currently under development, please be patient and wait for the completion of the project)

---

We plan to develop Tea language virtual machines using 2 different languages:

***TeaVM-CSharp:***

Fastest update, but running efficiency may be low (running on C # CLR)

***TeaVM-Cpp:***

Slow update but more efficient operation

Because the project has just been established, there is currently only one version of virtual machine (TeaVM-CSharp) available. Another version (TeaVM-Cpp) will be launched in the future.
